# Starling

A command-line interface for simplified, coordinated, decentralized storage on the Filecoin network. This is a work in progress and is not yet production-ready. Use at your own risk.

## Requirements

Starling CLI requires a machine running a Filecoin Lotus node and NodeJS v10.16.0 +

## Development

To run locally

```js
> npm install
```

During development itâ€™s convenient to make the symlink on our path point to the index.js weâ€™re actually working on, using `npm link`.

```js
> npm link
```

Test by running

```js
> starling <command>
```

### database

Starling uses an [sqlite3](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sqlite3) database. The db is created in `HOME/.starling/starling.db`

## API Address Config

Starling uses the Lotus configuration files for getting the API's url and authorization token (~/.lotus/api and ~/.lotus/token).
Please make sure that an authorization token with admin permissions has been generated beforehand (`lotus auth api-info --perm admin`)

Starling will use the optional `FULLNODE_API_INFO` variable in case it has been set. 
## Commands

Modify the config file `HOME/.starling/config.json`

```js
> starling config
```

Store a single file

```js
> starling store full/path/to/file
```

Store a folder

```js
> starling store full/path/to/folder
```

Launch interactive monitoring interface

```js
> starling monitor

// up/down keys: scroll through the list
// ^S sort by size, ^V sort by filename
// ^F: filter all files
```

Generate a CSV report of all files stored

```js
// outputs file in the working directory
> starling list

// outputs file in the specified directory
> starling list <path>
```

Generate a CSV report of file fixity

```js
// outputs file in the working directory
> starling verify

// outputs file in the specified directory
> starling verify <path>
```

Output the version number

```js
> starling --version | -v
```

Output usage information

```js
> starling --help | -h | help

> starling [command] --help
```
