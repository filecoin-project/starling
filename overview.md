Starling is a decentralized storage application designed for use in archival settings, where the ability to demonstrate the authenticity of a file over the course of time is of paramount importance.

## Lots of copies keeps stuff safe
When you store files with Starling, it will store however many redundant copies of your file you want, and ensures that these copies are kept safe.

## Proof of authenticity
Why blindly trust a black-box owned by one of the big three cloud storage providers? Starling leverages the power of the crowd, using Filecoin's [openly documented](https://filecoin.io/#research) cryptographic proofs, so that you know *for sure* that the person you are paying to store your data is really doing what they say they are, and that your files have not been modified or become corrupt.
